# 100DoS-challenge3
=======

Following along with 100 Days of Swift by HackingWithSwift.com https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

This is a challenge compelted entirely with my own code from day 41 and is a hangman game.

It's not pretty, but it works.

Skills include:
- Running thread in the background
- parsing a text file
- checking words for characters
- creating UI programatically
- responding to button presses
