# 100DoS-challenge4
Following along with 100 Days of Swift by HackingWithSwift.com https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

This was days 16 - 18 and involved making an image browser within a navigation controller. (project 1)
Then later in the course I took a copy (this one) and changed it from a tableview to a collectionview with my own code.

Skills include:
- navigation coltroller
- UIImage
- UIImageView
- Collection View

Challenges completed with my own code are:
- Modified so that loading the list of NSSL images from the bundle happens in the background. (Day 40 challenge)
- Modified from a table view app to a collection view app (Day 44 challenge)
